    correctAnswer: "The Use of Force Continuum",
    explanation: "The Use of Force Continuum is a model that illustrates the appropriate officer response based on the level of resistance from a suspect. Levels typically include Officer Presence, Verbal Commands, Soft Empty Hand, Hard Empty Hand, Intermediate Weapons, and Deadly Force.",
    reference: "TCOLE Use of Force"
  },
  {
    question: "A suspect who is clenching their fists, taking a bladed stance, and yelling 'You're not arresting me!' is exhibiting what level of resistance?",
    options: [
      "Passive resistance",
      "Verbal resistance",
      "Active resistance",
      "Aggravated/Deadly resistance"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Active resistance",
    explanation: "This suspect has gone beyond verbal resistance. Their physical posture (fists, stance) indicates an intent to physically resist the arrest, which is 'active resistance' and justifies a higher level of force (e.g., hard empty hand, Taser).",
    reference: "TCOLE Use of Force"
  },
  {
    question: "After handcuffing a suspect, what is the *next* essential step?",
    options: [
      "Read them their Miranda rights",
      "Place them in the patrol car",
      "Search the suspect for weapons or contraband",
      "Double-lock the handcuffs"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Search the suspect for weapons or contraband",
    explanation: "After securing the suspect in handcuffs, the *immediate* next step is a thorough search incident to arrest. Double-locking is done after the search (or immediately after cuffing), but the search is the critical safety step.",
    reference: "Arrest and Control Procedures"
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is considered an 'intermediate weapon'?",
    options: [
      "Handgun",
      "Verbal command",
      "Baton or OC Spray",
      "Joint lock"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Baton or OC Spray",
    explanation: "Intermediate weapons are tools that are less-lethal but have a higher probability of causing injury than empty-hand techniques. Batons, OC Spray, and TASERs fall into this category.",
    reference: "TCOLE Use of Force"
